# go-state-channel

An example showing how to pass request-invariant state through channels.

See [http://www.magnusson.io/misc/go-state-channel.html](here) for an detailed
explanation.

To run this, try:
```
$ go build
$ ./test
```

Also try the same on the previous commit (after cleaning up the binary).
